# E-commerce Project

This is a project that was developed in Udemy's course: [Curso de PHP 7](https://www.udemy.com/curso-completo-de-php-7/).

The template that i'm using is: [Almsaeed Studio](https://almsaeedstudio.com).

## Testing/see the project

If you want to test or see the project, here are some recomendations:

 - You must have version 7 of [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html);
 - You need to create a new database in your localhost with the name db_ecommerce, and import with the archive that is in the folder "database";
 - Clone this project inside htdocs;
 - Configure your hosts in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc  *<- If you are using Windows*, and set this:

 ```
     127.0.0.1           www.hcodecommerce.com.br
 ```

 - Configurate your httpd-vhosts.conf file:

 ```
     <VirtualHost *:80>
         ServerAdmin somerandomemail@gmail.com 
         DocumentRoot "C:/xampp7/htdocs/ecommerce-php7" <-- Here you need to change the path 
         ServerName www.hcodecommerce.com.br <-- The host configuration that you applied in hosts
         ErrorLog "logs/dummy-host2.example.com-error.log"
         CustomLog "logs/dummy-host2.example.com-error.log" common
         <Directory "C:/xampp7/htdocs/ecommerce-php7"> <-- Change the path here too
             Require all granted

             RewriteEngine on

             RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
             RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
             RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
         </Directory>
     </VirtualHost>
 ```
 - Restart or turn on the Apache and the MySQL;
 - After this you only need to have a browser, a computer or notebook and test the project ;).
